# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This Project was Created as Part of the SystemTron ML Internship - Week 1 Task
## Project Description
A binary classification model to prdeict whether a person is diabetic based on medical parameters like glucose, BMI, insulin, etc.
## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab
## Accuracy Achieved Appproximately **78%** uisng Logistics Regression.
## How It Works
1.Load and preprocessing the data
2.Train a machine learning model
3.Evaluate the model
4.Build a prediction system for real-time input
## Credits
Thanks to SystemTron for the opportunity to build this real-world ML project !
